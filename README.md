# React Mock Interview Practice

This is a repository I made for watching a React Mock Interview via Youtube.
I watched it first then tried to solve the problem on my own.
The website is not responsive.

## What I learned

- It's always good to practice and voice out your thought patterns while coding
- Never be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck
- Use good HTML semantics
- Application of slice method on a real project:

```js
const MAX_CATS = 6;
const App = () => {
  return (
    <section className="App">
      {CATS.slice(0, MAX_CATS).map((cat) => {
        return <Card {...cat} />;
      })}
    </section>
  );
};
```

## Further Development

- You can make the website responsive by collapsing the grid
- More UX/UI design
- Use API for more or real live data
